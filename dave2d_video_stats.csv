It's equipped with a fully magnesium body, an RTX 2070 MaxQ,  i7-9750H, a BIG battery and great thermal performance. It's REALLY weird that they made something better than so many other big name brands.

It's lighter, a better performer and has a bigger battery than the MSI GS65, Razer Blade 15, Alienware M15. The Aero 15 has a slightly bigger battery but this is noticeably lighter.

Excellent thermal performance with easily upgraded hardware. Acer did a fantastic job on this. It's not as durable as an Alienware device but it will be cheaper and lighter with awesome performance.

The 8th gen CPU from Intel has 6 cores but the thermal design of the 15"" MacBook Pro isn't cut out for removing the heat. The true-tone screen is awesome. It's still one of the best screens on the market and is very bright. Third gen butterfly switch keyboard has the membrane to prevent dust from coming in. And the option for 32 gigs of ram is great but it's still a MacBook Pro and there will be thermal limitations on this design.

Like the new MacBook Pro, not much has changed aesthetically, The new 4k display panel is a little brighter. Awesome for content creation. Fortnite and other moderately demanding games run at a good frame rate on the GTX 1050 Ti but keep in mind visuals are capped at 60 FPS because of the screen. The 2018 XPS 15 is still an excellent laptop for content creation but the thermal design of the laptop needs to be improved.

Legion Y530 - https://amzn.to/2KhTWz1

With thin bezels and good build quality, Lenovo has heavily improved their Legion laptop this year. It's less expensive than the Legion Y570 but retains the performance. This is the cheapest gaming laptop I've seen with thin bezels like this. Configurable with a GTX 1050 Ti and 8th gen Intel processors, performance is very respectable for current titles.

This is a cursory look at the varying levels of customer support in the industry. I'd love to dive WAY deeper in and get data on processing, repair and shipping times from the different brands. But that's super hard to coordinate. Maybe in the future!

Available Here - https://amzn.to/2GBN7KM

Gaming laptops are about to get much faster with the latest introduction of 6 cores and one of the products leading the way is the MSI GS65 Stealth. MSI manages to keep this laptop pretty light at 4.14 pounds and 17.53mm thin. Even with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 with Max-Q design. The RGB lit keyboard and a glass-coated touchpad are a nice touch. Gaming looks great with the 15.6 inch running at 144Hz with a 7ms response time.

Razer Mamba HyperFlux - http://amzn.to/2I8Fbh4

Razer’s new HyperFlux Wireless Power Technology is a great step forward for gaming hardware. Gamers now have access to a wireless mouse that doesn’t contain a battery for an smooth ultra-lightweight gaming experience. Having the Razer Mamba on a Firefly HyperFlux mousepad will keep it charged indefinitely with wireless power. The combination of a 16,000 DPI 5G optical sensor with swappable hard and soft mouse pad texture is awesome.

The variable aperture lens is cool. But when you compare photos from the S9, keep aperture number in mind. (Don't compare low light F2.4 photos with low light F1.5 photos)

Other phones like the iPhone X and the Pixel 2 XL have very wide apertures as well!

Coupon Code: MCA30

The Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro is a great option for people on a tighter budget. It's a powerful but inexpensive laptop for students in highschool or college.  It can handle light games and is a strong performer for multi-core applications. But customer support will likely be an issue if things go wrong.

Zolo Liberty Plus - http://amzn.to/2BdQ9Pd
Apple AirPods - http://amzn.to/2yFaqKT
Crazybaby Air Nano - http://amzn.to/2AV3iQn


Apple’s AirPods are great but they're not cheap and they have some issues. Zolo and crazybaby’s earpods are a great alternative to Apple’s AirPods that work with Android and Apple devices. Anyone looking to pick up some good bluetooth earphones should take a look at the AirPod, Air Nano and the Zolo Liberty Plus.

Microsoft’s new Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet is a great looking hybrid device with the perfect hardware for power hungry consumer. The surface book 2 can be purchased with an i7 Intel Core processor,  GTX 1050 or GTX 1060, 267 PPI PixelSense Display, 17 hour battery life and up to 16GB of RAM. The flexibility of the laptop and tablet mode can come in handy for many situations and can be the perfect solution for students looking for a lightweight, strong 2 in 1. The lack of a thunderbolt 3 port does limit it's ability to connect to external GPU's and multiple 4k displays.

OnePlus is looking to join the large screen to body ratio market with their new OnePlus 5T. OnePlus decided to shake things up a little and changed their cameras to a 16 MP main camera and a 20 MP secondary for enhanced low-light photography. Unlocking your phone will be super fast with their fingerprint sensor and face unlock. The OnePlus 5T is one of the best phones for it’s price range competing against the S8, LG V30, Essential PH-1, Pixel 2 XL and the iPhone X.

UPDATE TO THUNDERBOLT 3 PCI-E X2
THANKS TO JAMES McMINN FOR THE CLARIFICATION!

""The port itself still runs at 40Gbits/s - this is not affected by the number of PCI-e lanes. Thunderbolt acts as an interface for many different types of signal, PCI-e data being only one of them. A Single PCI-e lane runs at 8Gbit/s, so 4 lanes can provide upto 32Gbit/s, whilst 2 lanes can provide 16Gbit/s. DisplayPort data itself is provided on a different set of dedicated display lanes, and is capable of carrying up to 34Gbit/s worth of DisplayPort data - enough to power 2 4k displays at 60Hz. A Thunderbolt 3 port will happily supply a full 40Gbit/s using data from any number of sources, be it PCI-e, DisplayPort or USB, so long as the combined total stays below the maximum of 40Gbit/s that the port is able to handle.

For example, a Thunderbolt 3 port may supply 32Gbit/s of DisplayPort data, and an additional 8Gbit/s of PCI-e data, for a total of 40Gbit/s, or it could provide 16GBit/s of PCI-e bandwidth, 16Gbit/s of DisplayPort data - it doesn't really matter as long as the total bandwidth is kept under the limits for each set of lanes and the total limit (40Gbit/s) for the TB 3 port.

Whilst the 2 PCI-e lanes may be a limiting factor for eGPU usage in the future, it currently has little impact unless the internal display is being used, and will not affect how many displays the XPS 15 can handle.""
