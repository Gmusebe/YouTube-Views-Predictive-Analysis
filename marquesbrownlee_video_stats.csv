Also side not not mentioned in the video: I think a lot of us forget that 1280x720 on a 4.7"" display is still really quite sharp (300+ ppi), and the average consumer won't see a difference in sharpness between this and the HTC One, for example. It'll be more about colors and saturation. And this is an OLED display so colors will pop more and appear brighter to the average shopper holding them side by side in store. Crazy, right?

Clearly Google's voice search is ridiculously fast. Some like Siri's beauty & others like Google's simplicity. Which side are you on?

Note: The Galaxy Nexus was running Android 4.1 Jellybean and the iPhone 4S was running iOS5. Both were on the same Wifi network.

Full list of questions asked:

Round 1 [Easy]:
Is it going to rain tomorrow?
How hot is it in topeka?
What's the weather in Belgium?
Convert 1 pound to ounces.
What is the capital of Florida?
Who is the president of Egypt?
How big is Japan?
How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?
How tall is the Sears/Willis Tower?
How tall is Yao Ming?
When is Tiger Woods' Birthday?

Round 2 [Difficult]:
Did the Yankees win?
What movies has Brad Pitt been in?
Where are nearby theaters?
Where can I get sushi nearby?
What is the area code for Beverly Hills?
Remind me to go to the gym tomorrow at 9AM.
Set a timer for 2 minutes.
Note to self: Get more cereal!

Here's what Apple sued for, word-for-word:

 • A rectangular product shape with all four corners uniformly rounded;
 • the front surface of the product dominated by a screen surface with black borders;
 • as to the iPhone and iPod touch products, substantial black borders above and below the screen having roughly equal width and narrower black borders on either side of the screen having roughly equal width;
 • a display of a grid of colorful square icons with uniformly rounded corners; and
 • a bottom row of square icons (the ""Springboard"") set off from the other icons and that do not change as the other pages of the user interface are viewed.

1,024 x 768 = 786,432
3,145,728 / 786,432 = 4X the pixels!

First impressions of the hardware a pretty solid. I like the fluidity of the 24"" slider for such a low budget item and I've been impressed with the build quality so far. Watching review of the slider doesn't really give a good impression of the weight, but with a DSLR or heavier camera the IndiSlider handles friction with the rails very well. This allows for nice, fluid reveal shots and slider motions during videos. OVerall it's an excellent product at an excellent price.

We all can be fairly confident that Apple will continue its annual product release schedule and unveil a Verizon LTE-based 4G iPhone 5 this summer and likely piss off millions of former AT&T customers.

Verizon peeps - I know how you feel! You've been waiting for years. A few more months can't hurt much. Let the iPhone 5 rumors begin!

iPhone 5 on Verizon LTE solves:
~ Nominal speed difference between AT&T vs Verizon
~ No Voice and Data at the same time on 3G
~ Pissed off early adopters of VZW iPhone 4

The panels themselves have an incredible array of connectivity options and a stunning sharp resolution. They come with a power cable, DVI cable, VGA Cable, and USB cable in the box. Setup tour soon?

Experience high definition sound while on the move with these ultra light and comfortable on-ear headphones. Advanced proprietary titanium coated driver technology ensures they preserve every bit of the lush bass, vital details and high energy your favorite artists created for their fans. Plus, the ingenious tri-fold design makes for easy storage when not in use. Solo HD's cable also features Monster ControlTalk for iPod playback control and iPhone, iPods, and iPad. Pardon the cameo by the Zune HD in the video, as ControTalk does not actually work with this device.

There are a number of noteable changes to Safari 5, including the layout, which I can compare to Google Chrome [Safari 4 vs Google Chrome Coming Soon?] So enjoy this tutorial and enjoy the fastest web browser for Windows!

By the way, I performed the Acid3 test on the Safari 4 Beta - a procedure neccesary for every web browser! It scored a perfect 100/100 on the test on it's first try, proving that Apple really did make some webkit changes in Safari 5!

Also, this browser is VERY FAST!

This solves the problem of how to get the progress bar back in Safari. They've brought it back by itself!

Here I review the wireless, flexible, multimedia enabled keyboard kindly sent out to me by the kind folks at DSI.

My First Impressions: It's surprisingly thin! Thin enough that it can be wrapped up and shipped in a TUBE, not a box. Very nice! It's going to be nice traveling with this, as it has little/no weight and can be fitted quite easily into a laptop bag. Can't wait to review this in 1-3 weeks!

Final Review: The folding keyboard from DS International is a revolutionary idea. A keyboard that is not only spill proof and easy to type on - but can also FOLD up to be put anywhere from your pocket, to a briefcase, or a drawer. Perfect for people on the go! One common misconception is that the keyboard will not be sturdy, and could rip. It is actually made of a waterproof material that can be completely submerged for cleaning, and even used underwater. This material will not rip!

Final Grade: 8/10

Reccomended for: Travelers, Netbook users

The kind folks at iSkin were generous enough to send out a pair of their Bluetooth Headsets for review. Here is my unboxing video of the iSkin Cerulean F1 + TX!

In the Box:

iSkin Headphones
USB Charging Cable
User's Guide
TX (Bluetooth Adapter)
USB -- TX Adapter
Extra Earbud Rubber Tips

First Impressions:

The packaging, first of all, is very clean. Certain companies (Like Apple, Sony) spend a lot of time with their packaging, and it definiteily pays off in the first impressions. The headset itself is very very light, but it still has enough mass to it that it won't fall out of your ears!

Overall, looks like a great device, and I can't wait to review it for you guys!

Here I give my review and final analysis of the iFrogz Earpollutin Custom Fallouts kindly send out to me by the awesome people at iFrogz!

Pros: These headphones are loud, crisp, and very comfortable over the ear. It doesn't say they're noise isolating, but I feel like they are with the amount of foam surrounding your ear and the placement of the drivers. These style headphones are also quite a bit louder and more sensitive than in-ear earbuds.

Cons: Not nearly as portable as any other headphones.

Also: Adjustable and customizeable!

Here's one of my favorite Firefox addons. It's called ""Fission."" It enables you to have a Safari-like progress bar where the Firefox address bar always it, for free! I think it's an essential addon for former Safari users who've begun making the Switch to the Firefox 3.5 Browser!

In this tutorial, i'll show you how to customize Fission, and even set it to look almost exactly like the previous Safari 3.2.2 loading bar.

First Impressions: It's surprisingly thin! Thin enough that it can be wrapped up and shipped in a TUBE, not a box. Very nice! It's going to be nice traveling with this, as it has little/no weight and can be fitted quite easily into a laptop bag. Can't wait to review this in 1-3 weeks!

Here I'm reviewing the Griffin Elevator Laptop Stand kindly sent out to me by Griffin Technology.

The stand is made of a brushed aluminum, and has rubberized pads on the top and bottom to prevent sliding. They work perfectly. The stand was actually able to support not just a MacBook Air (as shown on the box) but will also work for a medium-weight 15"" Sony Vaio, as well as a beefed-out 17"" HP Pavilion. It's really really sturdy.

The fact that it's so far off of the ground provides 2 major pros: Airflow is number two... Minor cooling is provided because the air is flowing through the bottom of the stand, between the laptop and the desk. The number one pro is the fact that it's elevated up to the same height as a monitor, which provides a great viewing angle for someone who uses their laptop a lot.

This is best used if you have a laptop with an external keyboard, mouse and monitor!

Youtube is now allowing any and every user to download all of their own videos, no matter what format they were uploaded in. They will be downloaded in a Low Quality .mp4 format, which means you'll need Quicktime Player in order to view them.

The upside of this is that is saves your title for you. But the downside is the unusually bad quality. Either way, it's fast, convenient, and compressed and works perfectly!

Guys, These headphones have been absoultely awesome, and a pleasure to unbox. In the box, you get not only the headphones, but you get the over-ear plastic pieces, three different silicone in-ear buds, and the filter changing tool as well as a number of different filters that will be covered in the review video.

First Impressions: I love that they come with a lost more than just the headphones themselves. That is an admirable touch. They're packaged nicely, and the headphones have a very clean, glossy look that is attractive from the start. I can't wait to review these for you guys in 1-3 weeks. Stay tuned!

Here's an unboxing video for you guys, of the Sena Cases Ultraslim Leather Pouch for the LG Voyager.

First impressions: It's definitely real leather (it passes my super-scientific smell-test). It's a nice looking pouch, and even comes with a larger, softer pouch for travel. I really like companies who include more than just the product - And Sena Cases is nice enough to send a travel pouch for your LG VX10000 case!

I'll be sure to get back to you guys with a review video of the Ultraslim Leather Pouch in 1-3 weeks!

The GelaSkin wasn't very difficult to install, didn't take too much effort, and it was worth the final looks. Even if you don't like the design you saw in the video you can still visit the below link to check out more possible images you'd like - there are a TON of designs, and you're bound to find one you'll like!

These GelaSkins don't only come for 17"" laptop PC's, but also for MacBooks, and smaller 15.4"" and 13"" laptops as well. The skins are also made for smaller devices like cell phones, PDA's and iPods.

Uninstallation (not on camera) was quite painless, and left no residue whatsoever. I like it!

Below the full Youtube search box, there's a search box next to your videos that allows you to search JUST that user's videos. Use it! A lot of questions I get have already been answered, whether they are written on my channel page or have been mentioned in a video.

From now on, if anyone happens to ask about something I've already demonstrated, I'll reply with a specific keyboard in all CAPS!

Example:

User: Can you do a video about Google Chrome? I'm having trouble installing it...

Here I review the DSI Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard, kindly sent out to me by the kind folks at DS International.

It is a very lightweight, slim keyboard, but takes very little getting used to. The keyboard has a small amount of travel, and sounds nice when typing. I liked the integrated touchpad - a nice touch, so an out-of-battery mouse is never a real problem. It's so thin that it's space-saving, and it also has a TON of hotkeys and special function keys for easy access to those often hidden features of Windows.

The mini usb receiver travels up to 10 feet, and runs at a 2.4 GHz frequency. Being wireless was never a problem, like it is for some keyboards and mice.

I know the lighting's not so good, but I'm new to this :)

Here's my final impressions and review video of the SOLO 17"" Laptop Messenger Bag kindly sent out to me by the nice folks at SOLO.

I was actually able to use the bag twice in order to conduct this review. It's a really full-featured bag, and the main 17"" sleeve for the laptop is well-padded, and is fastened shut with velcro. The bag comes with a nice, large, adjustable shoulder strap with a non-skid padding, and it's comfy enough to carry a heavy laptop in for a long period of time.

The organizer and accessory pockets under the front flap are well-placed and there was just something about the zippered pocket that was just SO well designed, it kept everything compact without squishing everything. It's brilliantly made!

Laptop Pocket Size:
16 x 11 x 2 in. / 40.6 x 27.9 x 5.1 cm

Dimensions:
18 x 13 x 4 in. / 45.7 x 33.0 x 10.2 cm

Here is my overall review and final impressions video of the USB 2.0 Keyboard with Hub and Dock kindly sent out to me by Matias.

It's a decent keyboard. It has a very soft feel, sturdy build, and although it isn't jam-packed with unique features, it has a few things that are unique about it that separate it from the rest of the keyboards in this price range.

A Tab key on the number pad allows one-handed number entry into forms and spreadsheets, leaving your other hand free to hold or flip through information being entered.

The USB 2.0 Keyboard has two USB plugs - One connects the Keyboard and USB 1.1 hub to your computer, and the second connects the USB 2.0 Dock directly to a USB 2.0 port on your computer, providing full power and speed to the Dock.

First of all, before you ask - the audio had problems being synced to the Camera unboxing, so I just left the original camera audio. No biggie.

Anyway, here is my unboxing and first impressions video of the Fire-i Digital Camera kindly sent out to me by UniBrain. It's a small, lightweight color digital camera that can be used as a webcam. It runs off of a 1394 Firewire cable (6-pin) and is a sliver color on the outside. It also comes with a mini-tripod and a Software CD.

First Impressions: The camera is smaller than it looks in any pictures, and it looks handy that the camera is much more portable because of this. The mini tripod is of solid build, and can even be used for a regular-sized digital camera, and even has telescopic legs!

Here is my final review video and final impressions of the iFrogz Earpollution D33's. They're budget noise cancelling earbuds from iFrogz, and come in a variety of colors. The sound? Crisp. Clean. Clear. But it's lacking just a tiny bit of base.

Blurb from their site:

Earpollution D33 earbuds are not only noise isolating headphones, but also offer a snug secure fit and rich deep sound. Each package includes 3 ear fits and a convenient travel case. The metallic colors and PVC Radioactive patch are stylish and easily recognized as part of the ifrogz family.

This paragraph describest the headphones perfectly. The fit was perfect, the travel case is convenient, and the metallic colorst are unique and special.

This video, due to it's extreme size, had to be scaled down (compressed) in order to be under 1 GB and uploaded to Youtube.

Anyway, here I unbox the DSI Wireless Slim PC Keyboard, which is actually considered an ergenomic keyboard, and it has a ton of hotkeys and a touchpad! 

First impressions: It looks really full-featured, while still maintaining a compact size and shape. it's got a Windows Key at the bottom middle of the shiny plastic bezel, which is green for a nice stylish touch that seems to stand out. It also has quite a bit of height adjustment. It comes with a user's manual and some AA batteries and a mini-USB receiver.

I can't wait to get using this thing, and the review will be out in 1-2 weeks!

Here is my unboxing and first impressions of the Matias USB 2.0 Keyboard With Hub and Dock. So far, it's looking like a decent keyboard, the dock on top is well placed, and there are a few unique buttons on it, such as the volume keys, and the LED lights for caps lock, num lock, etc... The keyboard is a bit soft, but yes - you do have to break it in!

Here's the full review video fo the SoundTech GN3 Desktop Microphone from Alto-Edge. The microphone is most impressive because of the fact that it's quality is beautiful! So getting quality power, stereo sound, and bass is definitely a strong point of this microphone.

This review video will be posted as a video response to the unboxing video (as always) so you guys can see exactly what came in the box.

The mic is phantom powered, and has 2 pivot points for easy customization for your setup. I reccomend this microphone for PC recording software, voice recognition software, internet chatting (VOIP or Skype) and other applications along those lines.

The neck is a 16-inch, made of rubber, with 2 pivot points. It is noise cancelling! It comes with a 10-foot stereo 3.5mm plug that plugs into any laptop or desktop's microphone port. The non-skid base is actually weighted, and made of metal, and has a nun-skid rubber bottom to prevent it from sliding.

Power supply: Phantom Power 3V DV

First Impressions:

This skin is very sturdy, the color of the skin is very vivid, and is very good quality. No complaints so far! We'll see how the installation goes...

First Impressions: First off, it's not made of leather, but it has a very dense, durable fabric on the outside and inside. We'll see if it lasts. Also, it fits the 17"" very snugly, but there's room in the extra pockets for chargers, phones, and other electronic accessories.

Here is my unboxing and first impressions video of the iFrogz Earpollution D33 Noise Isolating Earbuds. They are a nice black and yellow color, though there are other colors available at their website. You also get different sized earbuds, as well as a carrying case in the package.

First Impressions: The headphones LOOK nice!! I can't wait to try them out, they definitely look high quality, and the shape of them is really low profile, I like that. I love the fact that it comes with a carrying case. Companies that include accessories like this make me proud :)

There's an asymmetrical wiring to it, if you didn't already notice. That means the right earphone swings around the back of your neck conveniently, and I've always liked that feature. It says ""Noise isolating"" all over the box, so I really can't wait to see/hear the quality of these buds!

Here I'll go over a pretty sweet adjustable tilted stand I recieved from HandStands.

It's made of a solid plastic, and has a detachable USB 2.0 hub, and it features a 6-level vertical adjustment!

It provides a nice typing angle at its lowest setting, but any higher and you'll want to use an external keyboard. I'll show you where to adjust the stand in the video - there's a simple knob, and I was impressed at how high the stand could actually go.

There are no fans on this stand, but it does cool your laptop a bit from being off of the ground. Also, the 1-plug USB 2.0 powered hub means you only have to unplug 1 cord to go mobile!

The only cons are the lip that blocks the touchpad and/or headphone and mic jacks, and the fact that you pretty much have to remove the laptop to change the angle.

This is the unboxing video of the adjustable laptop stand kindly sent to me by:

http://www.handstands.com/

First impressions: It's made of a really solid plastic, and there's a convenient 4 port usb 2.0 hub on the back (powered). It doesn't look like it's going to break any time soon, but it's not aluminum like a lot of other coolers I've tried (See: NZXT Cryo LX Unboxing).

Overall, this looks like a solid piece of hardware, and I can't wait to get this up and set up running with an external keyboard!

Here I give my final opinions on the Hard Shell LG Voyager case sent to me by ExtremePDA. It's a nice case, and the real feature of it is its protective outside, and its inside doesn't ever scratch your phone. Although the installation is extremely quick and easy (to throw a case on it in the morning) uninstallation takes upwards of 2-3 minutes, even if you know what you're doing.

The case has a soft matte finish, although it is a hard rubberized case. It's more rugged than it looks. There's no screen protector or MicroFiber included. Overall, the case is very well made, it's not cheaply made at all - it's worth every cent for the protection!

Thanks to ExtremePDA for sending this out to me!

Here I'll show you a few nice ways to customize Microsoft Office Word 2007 to your wants or needs. There were a few people who asked me to do a video on changing the color theme/scheme in Word, but that wasn't worth a whole video by itself - so I did this one!

P.S. - For those of you who read the entire description: I'll be out for a few days with no videos, but I'll still answer PM's, comments and emails!

In this tutorial, I will show you how to customize the PIP (Picture-In-Picture) Effect in your Camtasia Studio 6 recording. This features is very useful when doing tutorials, or when showing hardware and software at the same time. I use Camtasia Studio 6 to edit ALL of my videos, and I use this feature a lot in my tutorials. I highly suggest you take advantage of it too.

Subscribers can PM me for Keys to this video editing software :)

Here I show you how to remove background noise, or white noise in your audio tracks. A lot of times I'll finish a tutorial and notice there's a lot of noise from my fans in the background - well no more! This method works for every audio format I can think of. It not only eliminates background noise, but it draws more attention and focus to your voice. I use it in this tutorial, so you can hear what it sounds like!

CCleaner is a freeware system optimization and privacy tool. It removes unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. It also cleans traces of your online activities such as your Internet history. But the best part is that it's fast (normally taking less than a second to run) and contains NO Spyware or Adware!

Check it out: http://www.ccleaner.com 

Comment by http://www.youtube.com/naryanr:

I would add, this program has the tendency to completely screw up google chrome. it did for me. if you are hit, 90% of the pages will display incorrectly and YouTube is rendered useless. uncheck all the boxes under the chrome logo to be safe. uninstalling and reinstalling won't fix it. the pages slowly fix themselves over a number of weeks, i had to wait.

I suggest you gollow his instrutcions (while under the ""cleaner tab"")!

True Type Fonts are the type when you are typing on, say, a Microsoft Word document - if you set the document to 100% scale, it's the EXACT same font that would come out on your printer - same size, same everything! I really like this feature of TrueType Fonts.

Windows XP: Put the font files into C:\Windows\Fonts
Windows Vista: Right-click on the font files, then click ""Install""
Mac OS X: Double-click the font file, then click the ""Install font"" button.

In this tech-related video (In HD 720p) I go over the newest version of the iMac, as released at http://www.apple.com/mac in early 2009. There are plenty of new features, looks, etc... I like this one quite a bit!

The iMac, one of my favorite Apple products ever made. Apple started off by dropping one of the 20 models and adding a third 24. Now the lineup consists of a baseline 20 and three 24not bad, considering the prices stayed the same, and you get a lot more computing power. Next is the processor speed. The 20 comes standard with a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB of DDR3 RAM, 320GB hard drive and the new NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card. That setup runs for $1199.00 and its a great deal. Next up is the group of 24s. They all have boosted specs, including faster processor, more RAM standard, bigger hard drives, and much better graphics cards from NVIDIA. Also, the iMac now supports up to 8GB of 1066MHz DDR3 RAM for increasedperformance. One thing that I noticed on the back of the iMac where the ports are located is theabsenceof Firewire 400.first the macbooksnow the iMac. So if your someone who is buying your first Mac and you have a Mini DV camcorder that youve used for family holidays, vacation etc. how will you import your footage? Time to buy a new cable! One last thing about the iMac, it now has 4 USB 2.0 ports rather than 3 and instead of the Mini DVI port, it has a Mini DisplayPort. So that wraps up the iMac.

Here I go over (In 720p High Definition) the newest features presented at http://www.apple.com/mac about the newest version of the (2009) Mac Mini. Watch for new overview of the newest in ports, connectivity, expandability, and hardware upgrades that separate this from the last generation of the Mac Mini!

Starting off with the Mac mini.where do I begin? It was introduced a couple years ago and got an update every so often. It reallydidntreceive much attention. As the introductory level Macintosh, the Mac Mini is the smallest and most affordable Mac computer. There was a lot of talk about Apple discontinuing the Mac Mini, but its not over yet! I was glad to see the Mac Mini get configuration updates and hardware boosts all around. It now comes standard with a NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics card, superdrive 2.0GHz Intel Core 2 Due processor and 1 GB of RAM and 120GB hard drive on the $599.99 model. Now if your willing to put in another 200 bucks, you can upgrade your memory to 2GB and a 320GB hard drive. There are also some new ports on the back of the machine. It now comes with 5 USB 2.0 ports, Firewire 800 and a Mini DVI and Mini DisplayPort outputs. Since the Mac Mini is powered by a NVIDIA chipset, it now has the capabilities of running dual displays, which I think is awesome for this entry level Mac. Overall, the Mac Mini Upgrade seems awesome and Im glad Apple kept it around.

You should be defragging your hard drive at least weekly! (Just had to get that off my chest) A lot of people don't know how often to  (or even how to) degragment their hard drive. Here I reccomend how often you defragment, and a piece of software to help you do so more easily.

Diskeeper Pro Premier offers a huge variety of features, including boot time defragmenting, automatic defragmenting schedule, a quick start guide, etc... Check out the newest version - it's SO worth the money!

I just wanted to put it out there - I don't use an iMac or a Mac Mini, but I have a Mac Pro downstairs and I was just browsing the web and found out that the Mac Line of desktop (except for the Mac Pro) have been refreshed. New processors, less power consumption (but more powerful processors) and an overall decent upgrade! If you're a true Mac OS X fanboy you'll buy these in like a week! 

Oh yeah - and stay tuned for a FULL review on what I find on Apple's website, maybe a 6 or 7 minute in-depth video. Thanks for watching!

In this tutorial, I'll show you how and where to download the newest Firefox 3.1 Beta from Mozilla. This new browser is supposedly the fastest and most complete version of Firefox yet! And it scores a decent 93/100 on the Acid3 test, proving the development that went into this new browser.

A note: Firefox preloader (see previous tutorial), Fission, and several addons are still compatible with the newest beta version of Firefox, however, a number of the others, and a few themes i liked were no longer compatible, and were rendered unusable.

But overall, this is the fastest, most stable, and leanest browser Mozilla has ever built! Download Firefox 3.1  beta 2 and try it out for yourself.

There are a number of noteable changes to Safari 4, including the layout, which I can compare to Google Chrome (Safari 4 vs Google Chrome Coming Soon!). So enjoy this tutorial and enjoy the fastest web browser for Windows!

By the way, I performed the Acid3 test on the Safari 4 Beta - a procedure neccesary for every web browser! It scored a perfect 100/100 on the test on it's first try, proving that Apple really did make some webkit changes in Safari 4!

Also, this browser is UNBELIEVABLY FAST!

This website, in the link below, is just one of the many customization options that are presented to Windows users. The Bricopacks are directed directly at Windows XP Users, but eveything else offered at this website it for any Windows Operating System.

The Bricopacks are a different sort of thing introduced by this already-popular website - it skins your entire Windows Experience, from icons to wallpaper to buttons, to the taskbar, etc. Another video is coming that is based directly on themes for Windows Vista - but this website is a very basic way of customizing your Windows Computer!

Just as a backup, it's always good to have another good Codec for recording your screencasts in HD. If the DivX codec isn't working for you (or it's causing microphone problems, like it did for me), then I suggest trying this next-best-option for broadcasting HD content! This is the Camstudio Lossless Codec.

This is a popular topic: VOIP clients are getting more and more popular now. Well here I do a very simplistic review of one of the more well-known ones, called Skype. I demonstrate a Skype chat, and I go over different features, including almost-instant free calling to other Skype users, video calling, conference calls, conference video, and conference messaging. It also includes a cool feature to tell which of your contacts are online, and imports your contacts from AIM and other IM clients into Skype!

Well here I actually show you how to get that link for the highest possible broadcasting quality in ANY Youtube video you shoot. I've even shot some videos with my 2-megapixel webcam and gotten the ""Watch in HD"" Link at the bottom of the page! It's all about encoding, baby!

Here I show you how to get the iTunes 8 Visualizer, just like you might find on a Windows machine in Windows Media Player 11. There are only 2 (really cool) built-in visualizer affects, but you can't really appreciate how nice they are with a small recording region and choppy framerates (my bad.) But I reccomend this to anyone who has an iPod or iPhone and wants the same effects they had in Windows Media Player in the iTunes Experience! This works with the later versions of iTunes.

Have you noticed a lot of the really good, really popular Youtube channels out there have some kind of Introduction video or closing ""saying?"" Well in this tutorial, I will show you how to make a Youtube Intro, the easy way - just using a couple of pictures you've got on your computer!

1. Go to: http://animoto.com/ like I did in the tutorial - create your video.

2. Hit the ""Export to Youtube"" Button I showed you.

3. Use Youtube Downloader (http://youtubedownload.altervista.org/) to download that short video directly from Youtube - I'm going to do a separate video on Youtube downloader, so stay tuned for that!

4. Once downloaded, use a video editing application (Camtasia Studio, Windows Movie Maker) To cut out the parts you don't like, and eliminate the annoying ""ANIMOTO"" Frame in the last 2 seconds of your video.

5. Now, whenever you want to upload a video, just use either Camtasia Studio or Windows Movie maker (or whatever you want!) To put your intro video you created right in front of your actual Youtube video!

6. Publish that file - and that's what you upload!

I've been reading up a ton recently about enormous performance increases experienced by Windows 7 Users - which brings to mind my question: Could Windows 7 Be a $50 upgrade? A lot of people have made the case that Windows 7 should be a free upgrade to Vista users - but knowing Microsoft, I think this is completely out of the question! So - could it be something more reasonable - like, say: 50 bucks?

In this tutorial, I will show you how to quickly diagnose problems that you make believe are associated with compatibility to Windows Vista. If you run the program in compatibility mode with an older operating system, it means that the program is not, in fact, having problems with Windows Vista - it's the program itself. But if running the program in compatibility mode solves your unexplained errors, it's most likely because of it's inability to function correctly with Windows Vista!

This works with any version of Vista, and the 'Print Screen' option demonstrated even works in older versions, like XP and even Windows 98. This can be quite useful when just showing a client or a friend just a screenshot (not a video) of your ""Windows Experience Rating,"" or some funky # in the calculator ; )

This piece of software allows you to simply shake a window - and all the windows behind it (or in front of it) are minimized! I know, it seems like just another ram-consuming piece of eye-candy from Microsoft - but maybe you want to try it out for yourself?

This tutorial will show you how to enable the much-discussed offline gmail feature now built in to Gmail. If you have a Gmail account and wish to check your email, say, on a plane, or in a coffee shop with an overloaded internet connection, or even while in your car on the way to work, you always have access to your gmail inbox.

Offline gmail (from my experience) is actually a bit faster than standard gmail because it loads components of your inbox's messages BEFORE you lose your internet connection - it's brilliant!

You saw it here first  -  this is youtube's first unboxing of this particular product...

World's largest full aluminum laptop cooler:
NZXT Cryo LX!

My first hardware unboxing, but all goes well - all I have to say is this cooler works REALY WELL!!

I give it a 10/10 for cooling (it's freezing cold when fans are on low)
I give it a 6/10 for portabliity (hullo, it's the world's largest! It's meant to stay on ur desk, but it DOES fold)
I give it a 10/10 for design (and I'm crazy bout the USB 2.0 powered hub, as well as the tilt factor and grips!)

I just love this cooler, and I reccomend it to anyone who has a really hot laptop or a 17"" or larger machine! It WILL cool ur XBOX!

Here's a test I did with the temperatures - they're by no means scientific - but it shows a significant temperature diff. between running the laptop on my desk and on the fans - full blast!

All temps are in fahrenheit!

Boot up WITHOUT cooler:

Idle temperatures after 5 minutes:

gpu: 104
core1: 64
core2: 72

Inserted a graphicy (definitely not a word) game and played for 15 minutes:

gpu: 140
core1: 74
core2: 81


WITH NZXT Cryo LX:

Idle temps after 5 minutes:
gpu: 93
core1: 59
core2: 69

Inserted game and played for 15 minutes:

gpu: 124
core1: 66
core2: 75
